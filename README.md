# Run
To run an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, you typically need a web browser. Here's a basic guide to get started:

1. **Set Up Your Project Directory**:
   Create a folder on your computer where you'll keep all your project files. Name it something relevant to your project.

2. **Create Your Files**:
   Inside your project folder, create the following files:
   - `index.html`: This will be your main HTML file.
   - `styles.css`: This will be your CSS file.
   - `script.js`: This will be your JavaScript file (optional if you don't have JavaScript).

3. **Write Your Code**:
   Open each file using a text editor (like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) and write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Your HTML file should contain the structure of your webpage, your CSS file should contain the styles, and your JavaScript file should contain any scripts you want to run.

4. **Link Your Files**:
   In your `index.html` file, link your CSS and JavaScript files. Add these lines inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML file:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

5. Preview Your Project:Double-click on the `index.html` file in your project folder. This should open it in your default web browser, allowing you to see how your project looks and functions.

6. Debugging and Editing:As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, save them and refresh your browser to see the changes. Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or pressing F12) to debug any issues.

7. Deployment:If you want to share your project with others, you can deploy it to a web server. There are many ways to do this, including using hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These platforms allow you to host static websites for free or at a minimal cost.

That's a basic overview of how to run an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project. As you become more familiar with web development, you may explore more advanced tools and workflows.
